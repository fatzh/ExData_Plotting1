Plotting Assignment 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

To run the R scripts, you must have a sub-directory "data" in your working directory containing the dataset, unzipped, that you can grab from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip).

Also the following R packages are required :
* tidyr
* sqldf

You can install them in R using ```install.packages(c("tidyr", "sqldf"))```
